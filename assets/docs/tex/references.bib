    abstract = { Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to visual tasks since the late 1980s. However, despite a few scattered applications, they were dormant until the mid-2000s when developments in computing power and the advent of large amounts of labeled data, supplemented by improved algorithms, contributed to their advancement and brought them to the forefront of a neural network renaissance that has seen rapid progression since 2012. In this review, which focuses on the application of CNNs to image classification tasks, we cover their development, from their predecessors up to recent state-of-the-art deep learning systems. Along the way, we analyze (1) their early successes, (2) their role in the deep learning renaissance, (3) selected symbolic works that have contributed to their recent popularity, and (4) several improvement attempts by reviewing contributions and challenges of over 300 publications. We also introduce some of their current trends and remaining challenges. }

    abstract = "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a biologically inspired trainable architecture that can learn invariant features for a number of applications. In general, CNNs consist of alternating convolutional layers, non-linearity layers and feature pooling layers. In this work, a novel feature pooling method, named as mixed pooling, is proposed to regularize CNNs, which replaces the deterministic pooling operations with a stochastic procedure by randomly using the conventional max pooling and average pooling methods. The advantage of the proposed mixed pooling method lies in its wonderful ability to address the over-fitting problem encountered by CNN generation. Experimental results on three benchmark image classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed mixed pooling method is superior to max pooling, average pooling and some other state-of-the-art works known in the literature.",
