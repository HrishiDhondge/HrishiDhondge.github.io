<h4>Background</h4>

<p>This is Hrishikesh Dhondge. I was born and brought up in the state of Maharashtra, India. I completed my primary school from my native town, Bahaddarpura. For further studies, I joined Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Shankarnagar(Nanded). I completed my Secondary school and Higher Secondary school from there. </p>
<p>Then I went to MGMâ€™s College of Computer Science & Information Technology, Nanded for my Bachelors. I obtained B.Sc. in Bioinformatics from there. During this time, I learnt the basics and developed interest in programming. Later, I decided to join the Centre for Bioinformatics, Pondicherry University. I obtained M.Sc. in Bioinformatis from there. During this time, I also  did a summer internship at Bose institute (Kolkata, India), where I worked on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis and machine learning. My Masterâ€™s thesis focused on DNA-based data storage systems, having developed a system with a storage density of 1 byte per two nucleotide base pairs without any compression, and based on hexadecimal data instead of binary data.</p>
<p>Currently, I am enrolled as a PhD student at LORIA-INRIA, Nancy under IAEM doctoral school, University of Lorraine. I am a part of RNAct which is a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Innovative Training Network (MSCA-ITN) project.</p>

<h4>Interest</h4>
<p>My research interest includes structural biology, machine learning and NGS data analysis.</p>
