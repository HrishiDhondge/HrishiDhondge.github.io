<h4>Background</h4>

This is Eden Au. My journey started when I took IT classes in high school where I learned how to code (in Pascal🐆 for some reasons). My hard work paid off as I was awarded silver medal🥈 and distinction in Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (Senior Group) and Canadian Computing Competition respectively. I built a [School Internal Examination Seating Arrangement System💯💺]({{ site.url }}/exam-sitting) for secondary schools in Hong Kong in my final year.

I went for Engineering in university as I like solving problems. I chose Oxford as they offered two years of general engineering courses, and I chose University College (Univ) as they have the best tutors (<a href="https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk/academics/stephen-collins/" target="_blank">Dr. Steve Collins</a> is one the best). Engineering science is a very broad field, it includes civil, mechanical, electrical, electronic, material, biomedical, chemical, information etc., and I learned the basics of structures, fluids, thermodynamics, engineering computation, energy systems etc.. I decided to do Information Engineering📟 and focused on <i>a) machine learning🎰🤔, b) control theory🎮, and c) signal processing🚦</i>.

I developed several algorithms and applications during my time in Oxford. I made [a simple Android app📱]({{ site.url }}/checkpoint) such that everyone can explore a city easily, [a simple algorithm that calibrates a pinhole camera📷]({{ site.url }}/camera-calibration), and [a distributed optimization algorithm for increasing service level of station-based bike sharing systems🚴]({{ site.url }}/bike-sharing).

I was an active university member. I was the Vice-President of Oxford Hong Kong Society, a researcher in OxPolicy: the Oxford Student Think Tank, and a founding member of Oxford Coding Society (help spread the love of coding💌). I also took the opportunity to gain more experience in data science. Go to my <a href="{{ site.url }}/resume/">resume</a> for more details.

After 4 years of undergraduate study in Oxford, I went to Edinburgh in September 2018 for my PhD study. I am now focused on leveraging machine learning in climate modeling. Since I did general engineering before, I believe it is well-handled. I am now looking for different opportunities to gain more experience in data science (please contact me if you have something to offer!).

<h4>Interest</h4>

My research interest includes using machine learning, control theory, and signal processing techniques in natural sciences and real life applications. One particular interest would be developing physics-informed machine learning models where known physics and prior knowledge are incorporated, such as conservation laws.

I believe we can all contribute to our society🗺️ in various means. I was a mentor in Boundless where I provided mentorship to under-resourced students that facilitated their personal growth, and training that equipped them with skills that could help them succeed in their respective pursuits. I have also been working in Project Access Hong Kong for more than 2 years to help talented less-privileged young people around the globe achieve their academic goals.

If you think I would be a great addition to your company/organization/team, please contact me🤙!
