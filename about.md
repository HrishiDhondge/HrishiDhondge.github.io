This is Eden Au. My journey started when I took IT classes in high school where I learned how to code (in Pascal🐆 for some reasons). My hard work paid off as I was awarded silver medal🥈 and distinction in Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (Senior Group) and Canadian Computing Competition respectively. I built a School Internal Examination Seating Arrangement System💯💺 for secondary schools in Hong Kong (available on <a href="https://github.com/edenau/HKSchool-Exam-Sitting-Arrangement">GitHub</a>) in my final year.

I went for Engineering in university as I like solving problems. I chose Oxford as they offered two years of general engineering courses, and I chose University College (Univ) as they have the best tutors (<a href="https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk/academics/stephen-collins/">Dr. Steve Collins</a> is one the best). Engineering science is a very broad field, it includes civil, mechanical, electrical, electronic, material, biomedical, chemical, information etc., and I learned the basics of structures, fluids, thermodynamics, engineering computation, energy systems etc.. I decided to do Information Engineering and focused on <i>a) machine learning, b) control theory, and c) signal processing</i>.
