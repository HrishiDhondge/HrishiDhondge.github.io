# Introduction

Bike sharing systems have become popular means of travel in recent years, providing a green and flexible transportation scheme to citizens in metropolitan areas. Many governments in the world have seen this as an innovative strategy that could potentially bring a number of societal benefits. For instance, it could reduce the use of automobiles and hence reduce greenhouse gas emission and alleviate traffic congestion in city centres.

> <a href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/attitudes-to-cycling-2016.pdf" target="_blank">Reports</a> have shown that 77% of Londoners agree that cycling is the fastest way to make short-distance journeys. In the long run, it might also help increase the life expectancy in the city.
