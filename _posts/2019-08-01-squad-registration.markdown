>> Why don’t rich football clubs just buy most of the big names on the market?

In order to prevent football clubs from stockpiling talents and to promote the development of local youth players, football clubs cannot buy and register whoever they want in their team. We have heard terms like ‘homegrown players’ and ‘squad registration rules’ on the news for so long, but what do they mean?

There are different registration rules for each league, and those rules are changing, hard to find, and sometimes quite complicated. In light of this, here is a summary of the squad registration rules for the top 4 levels of English league and European leagues.

<i>The following information is correct for 2019/20 season.</i>

## Technicality

- <b>A year</b>: an entire season or 12 months, whichever satisfies the criterion
- <b>Turning 15</b>: the <i>start</i> of the season during which they turn 15
- <b>Turning 21</b>: the <i>end</i> of the season during which they turn 21
- <b>Under-21 (or 19)</b>: under-21 (or under-19) on 31 December of the <i>previous</i> season
For example, U21 (or U19) players will have been born on or after 1 January 1998 (or 1 January 2000) in 2019/20 season [1]

Maximum of <b>17 non-homegrown senior players</b>, and
