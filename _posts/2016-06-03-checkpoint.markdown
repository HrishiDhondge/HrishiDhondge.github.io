# Introduction

Arnold, Matthew, and I designed this simple Android app from scratch in Summer 2016 within 4 days.

## Table of Contents

# Concept
* This app is designed so that you can explore a city or an area.
* If you have a list of locations you know you want to visit, this app will store that information and display it on a map, as well as tell you when your are near that location.

<div class="breaker"></div> <a id="main-map"></a>

# Main Map
This part of the app allows you to navigate around an area you donâ€™t know and visit locations that are nearby. It also alerts you when you reach the location youâ€™re looking for.

* Whole app relies on three .csv files containing Names, Latitudes, and Longitudes of locations.
* They are created (if they do not exist) and parsed to plot markers in this activity.
* The distances between your location and the checkpoints are calculated every time your location is updated, and if it is less than 30*m*, the marker is removed, and the entry is deleted from the list.

<div class="breaker"></div> <a id="list"></a>

# List of Checkpoints
This activity stores the locations that you have chosen.

* This activity displays the .csv files in a List view.
* There are *onClick* and *onLongClick* listeners allowing you to edit the elements in the list.
* If the list is edited, then the new .csv files are rewritten when the Add location returns a new location, when going back to the map, and *onPause*.

# Add Location Activity
This activity allows you to pick a new location to visit anywhere in the world. An improvement could be the ability to search within the app and the location that way.

* A long click on the map fragment records the Longitude and latitude of where you hold your finger. This is achieved with a *setOnMapLongClickListener*.
