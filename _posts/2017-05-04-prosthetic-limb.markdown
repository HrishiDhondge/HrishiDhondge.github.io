# Introduction

Prosthetics are designed to help amputees restore the basic functions of their missing limb. Currently, there are an estimated 1.6 million people living with limb loss in the United States and this number could double by 2050 [1].This is due to the combined effect of population growth and a rise in the incidence of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease [2].

With rapid developments in technology, amputees view their physical limitations as something which can be solved. At Tius prosthetics we hope our product provides for this evolving market looking for â€˜function over formâ€™.

Todayâ€™s prosthetic market provides a wide range of solutions appreciating that each userâ€™s needs are different. Devices are grouped under passive, manual, body powered and electric with customers including NHS (and other healthcare providers), charities and individuals.

The solutions available for transradial users are less extensive. Userâ€™s find themselves split between a lightweight, affordable, passive device and a heavy, expensive, electrical device. Much research has focused on reducing the weight of electrical models, however this often comes with a significant price-tag: 5-year electrical prosthetic costs are estimated to be $117,440 per person [3]. Consequently, we believe there is a gap in the transradial market for an electric prosthetic that is affordable, user friendly and lightweight.

# Specification

Key features of our design with include:

- A comfortable and secure socket suspension system which is simple to don
- A lightweight yet sufficiently strong forearm to house the electronics
- A manually manipulated locking wrist unit
- An electronic terminal device able to grasp objects of varying sizes, materials and masses
- A novel user interface in the form of a ring on the contralateral hand
- A battery management system designed for extended use and minimal charging time

Our design incorporates the above features into a single prosthetic. We believe giving it the potential to disrupt the transradial prosthetic market.

The design process began with a need identification. Which requirements did users feel the current market was failing to meet? Discussions with amputees revealed the following desires which are encompassed in our specification below.

Product Specification:
- To have a detachable yet electric terminal device
- To be able to carry at least 5 kg as a point load in the terminal device
- To be able to operate the terminal device using a ring in the contralateral hand
- To provide visual feedback when an item is gripped
- To have a minimum battery life of 10 hours (for a 9-5 jobs plus commute)
- To charge to 60% in two hours
- To be able to rotate and lock the wrist in 8 discrete positions
- For the total prosthetic to weigh under 1.5kg
- For the total prosthetic to cost under Â£1,000 with Â£350 raw material costs

This specification is accompanied by our overall product objective: to hold a pen, bike handle and pint of beer securely. Thus, permitting our user to live a typical student's life!

We will discuss each modular component in turn beginning with the socket and progressing to the distal end of the prosthetic where the terminal device and ring user interface are located. Each section, will outline the solutions and mechanisms researched and final design chosen. This will include a summary of the materials used, cost and mass, complete with justifications.
