Have you ever thought of being one of the passengers on the Titanic in 1912? Would you survive? Would your children survive? What would happen if you were in the upper deck? We are often told that women and children were given priority to the lifeboats, but I was not satisfied with this short, qualitative answer. With the advent of ***machine learning***, we are able to dig deeper. We can spot patterns and infer what would have happened to you and your family should you all were onboard.

## TL;DR
I developed a machine learning model that does so, and deployed it as a <a href="http://18.212.193.40:8888/" target="_blank">Web App</a>. Check out <a href="http://18.212.193.40:8888/" target="_blank">http://18.212.193.40:8888/</a> and complete the quiz to find out your chance of survival.

# Introduction
## Motivation
For data scientists, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic" target="_blank">Titanic Kaggle dataset</a> is arguably one of the most widely used datasets in the field of machine learning, along with MNIST hand-written digit, Iris flower etc.. For some non-data scientists, machine learning is a black box that does magic; but for some sceptics who ‚Äòlearn from the past‚Äô (and inadvertently human-trained a classification model in their head), they foresee that
