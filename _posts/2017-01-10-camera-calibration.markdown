# Introduction

Camera is a very common tool to capture our daily lives. Pinhole camera was invented that provided an economical option compare to other expensive ones. However, due to its design, the images acquired are distorted. To eliminate this inherent deficiency, one can use calibration tool to obtain a relatively accurate representation of the world captured.

# Objectives

The main point of camera calibration is to reconstruct the world by estimating the parameters of the camera such as focal length, skewness, or in general, intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. By doing so, we can achieve:
-	Image reconstruction
-	Distance and position measurement
