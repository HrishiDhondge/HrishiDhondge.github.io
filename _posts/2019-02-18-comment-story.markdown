# Dear Medium,

When you share this letter on Facebook, you create a ***post***. Your friends can make ***comments*** beneath it. People can respond to comments by writing ***replies***. You cannot read a comment without skimming through the post itself. Post-comment-reply, a very clear tree-shape hierarchy.

But when you share your thoughts on Medium, you write a ***story***. Everyone can respond to your story by writing a ***response***, which itself is a ***story***. If you want to reply to that response/story, you then create another response which itself is also a story. It can technically go infinitely deep. You can read a response without reading the main story. More like linked lists of stories.

Who cares? I didn‚Äôt know it mattered until I bumped into this:

I have published 10 ‚Äòstories‚Äô in 1.5 months, but only 4 of those are ‚Äòtrue stories‚Äô, i.e. not responses. I cannot imagine how can experienced writers stand this. In my opinion, grouping stories and comments together are bad, as

## It is a mess.
I have had a hard time trying to find my own real stories in my own profile. Many people are complaining. <a href="https://medium.com/@gubatron/dear-medium-comments-are-not-stories-dacdef44b255" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@ourielohayon/medium-please-fix-your-product-b063f800cb9d" target="_blank">there</a>.

## It is not intuitive.
We are not yet ready for the post-Facebook era.

## They are intrinsically different.
A comment itself is not a story. Stories are **self-contained** ideas and opinions.

Comments are strongly **context-dependent** and often shorter in length. Most of the comments are simply expressing gratitude or anger (or other emotions). Some of them are redirecting the audience to their own stories.

They have different natures, and sometimes values.

## This is just a symbolic thing.
>> Every voice is a story.
