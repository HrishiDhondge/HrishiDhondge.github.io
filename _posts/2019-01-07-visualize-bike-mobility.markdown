# Introduction

Bike sharing systems have become popular means of travel in recent years, providing a green and flexible transportation scheme to citizens in metropolitan areas. Many governments in the world have seen this as an innovative strategy that could potentially bring a number of societal benefits. For instance, it could reduce the use of automobiles and hence reduce greenhouse gas emission and alleviate traffic congestion in city centres.

> <a href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/attitudes-to-cycling-2016.pdf" target="_blank">Reports</a> have shown that 77% of Londoners agree that cycling is the fastest way to make short-distance journeys. In the long run, it might also help increase the life expectancy in the city.

I have been working on a data-driven cost-effective algorithm for optimizing (re-balancing) the system of Santander Cycles, a public bicycle hire scheme in London, which I should make a post about it once my paper is published (more info here). Before really working on the algorithm, I had to delve into loads of data and it would really help if I could somehow ***visualize*** them.

>> TL;DR‚Ää-‚ÄäLet's see how we can visualize a bike sharing system using graphs, maps, and animations.

*You can find web maps in this <a href="https://edenau.github.io/maps/" target="_blank">page</a>.

# More about Data‚Ää-‚Ääthe Boring¬†Bit

I obtained data of bicycle journeys from Transport for London (TfL). Every single bike journey made in their system since 2012 was recorded and those open data are available <a href="https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/" target="_blank">online</a>.

A 36-day record of journeys made from 1 August to 13 September 2017 were analyzed. During this period, there were >1.5 million journeys made among >700 bike docking stations in London. From 2014, we have witnessed a >190% rise in bike trips made. The number of bicycles and docking stations in the system both increased more than twofold to accommodate the significant rise in cycling demand in central London and regional areas. Exact data will be shown in my soon-to-be-released paper. Stay tuned.

## Data Manipulation
I believed there would be a massive difference in journey patterns between weekdays and weekends. Let's do some coding and see if this is true. We first import data of journeys by `pd.read_csv()`.

```
# Load journey data
f = 'journeys.csv'
j = pd.read_csv(f)
date = j['date'].values
month = j['month'].values
year = j['year'].values
hour = j['hour'].values
minute = j['minute'].values
station_start = j['id_start'].values
station_end = j['id_end'].values
```

Then we extract weekday data by `date.weekday()` and evenly divide a 24-hour day into 72 time slices, such that each time slice represents a 20-minute interval.

```
# Compute IsWeekday
weekday = np.zeros(len(date))
weekday[:] = np.nan
cnt = 0
for _year, _month, _date, _hour, _minute in zip(year, month, date, hour, minute):
  _dt = datetime.datetime(_year, _month, _date, _hour, _minute)
  _weekday = _dt.weekday()
  weekday[cnt] = _weekday
  cnt += 1
IsWeekday = weekday < 5
j['IsWeekday'] = IsWeekday
# Compute TimeSlice
j['TimeSlice'] = (hour*3 + np.floor(minute/20)).astype(int)
```

We also need to check if those bike trips were made from/to abolished stations, as there are no ways to obtain information of those stations, such as locations, station name etc. (good job TfL). We labelled them as 'invalid' journeys.

```
# Load station data
f = 'stations.csv'
stations = pd.read_csv(f)
station_id = stations['station_id'].values
# Extract valid journeys
valid = np.zeros(len(date))
valid[:] = False
cnt = 0
for _start, _end in zip(station_start, station_end):
  if np.logical_and((_start in station_id), (_end in station_id)):
    valid[cnt] = True
  cnt += 1
j['Valid'] = valid
```

Finally, we only keep journeys that are 'valid' **and** made on weekdays, which turns out to be around 73% of the data.

```
df = j[j["IsWeekday"] == True].drop(columns="IsWeekday")
df = df[df["Valid"] == True].drop(columns="Valid")
print('Ratio of valid journeys= {:.2f}%'.format(df.shape[0] / j.shape[0] * 100))
```

# Bar Charts

We finally delve into the visualization part! The simplest forms of data visualization are arguably charts. By a simple `groupby('TimeSlice')` function, we can see how frequent journeys were made in different hours.

```
grp_by_timeslice = df.groupby('TimeSlice').count().values[:,0]
plt.bar(range(0,72), grp_by_timeslice)
plt.xlabel('Time Slice')
plt.ylabel('Departures')
plt.show()
```

![Average departure rates on weekdays (left) and weekends (right)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/visualize-1.png)

See? our hypothesis is right! Journey patterns on weekdays and weekends are so different, as we can see two peak hours on weekdays, where most people commute, but not on weekends. We can also observe the distribution of journey duration and speed in a similar fashion.

![Distribution of journey duration (left) and speed (right)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/visualize-2.png)

Note that we assumed straight paths were taken due to data constraint (they don't track your movement), which would be shorter than the actual paths, and therefore the speeds computed with distances between start and end stations would be ***underestimated***. If customers return the bike at the same station it was rent, the computed speed would be 0, which explains the rather strange spike spotted at 0 km/h.

# Interactive Maps

If charts are fancy, maps are fancier. We will use `<a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/" target="_blank">folium</a>`, which is a Python wrapper of <a href="https://leafletjs.com" target="_blank">Leaflet.js</a> that makes interactive maps. Make sure you install the latest version by

```
$ pip install folium==0.7.0
```

(or its `conda install` equivalent). I worked on Google Colaboratory and the pre-installed version is `0.2.0` with minimal functionalities.

I built a simple template for generating a map with circle markers (with different colours!) using clusters.

```
import folium
# Change colours
def color_change(c):
    if(c < 15):
        return('red')
    elif(15 <= c < 30):
        return('orange')
    else:
        return('green')
# Create base map
London = [51.506949, -0.122876]
map = folium.Map(location = London,
                 zoom_start = 12,
                 tiles = "CartoDB positron")
marker_cluster = MarkerCluster(locations=[lat, lon]).add_to(map)
# Plot markers
for _lat, _lon, _cap, _name in zip(lat, lon, cap, name):
    folium.CircleMarker(location = [_lat, _lon],
                        radius = 9,
                        popup = "("+str(_cap)+") "+_name,
                        fill_color = color_change(_cap),
                        color = "gray",
                        fill_opacity = 0.9).add_to(marker_cluster)

f = 'map_station_cluster.html'
map.save(f)
```

Why clusters? `MarkerCluster()` enables markers to cluster together when they are too close when you zoom out. You do not want your maps to be too messy, with markers overlapping one another.

![Station cluster map]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/station-cluster-1.png)

It automatically de-clusters/unfolds when you zoom in:

![Station cluster map - zoomed in]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/station-cluster-2.png)

But I promised you ***interactive*** maps. You can set `popup` parameter and display station name and its capacity when you click on it. Bravo!
