NetCDF is a machine-independent, array-oriented, multi-dimensional, self-describing, and portable data format used by various scientific communities. It has a filename extension of *.nc* or *.cdf* (though it is believed that there are subtle differences between the two). Unlike files in *.csv* or *.xlsx*, NetCDF format cannot be accessed and viewed directly using spreadsheet software.
