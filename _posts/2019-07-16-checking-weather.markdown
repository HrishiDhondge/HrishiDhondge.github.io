Weather is closely linked to our daily lives, but I <b>hate</b> checking the weather.
How long do you spend your time browsing weather apps every day? Do you have a smooth experience in doing so? Weather forecast reports give me a vague sense of understanding about the weather outside, only to realize I was wrong (half of the time) when I stepped out of my home. I should have grabbed my jacket. I would miss my train if I went back to get it.

Was I misguided? Or did I misinterpret the weather report?

>> It is not your fault.

## 1. There is too much information

Weather forecasts include a myriad of factual information represented by numbers — <i>temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, UV index</i>, and the list goes on. What do all these combined together actually mean to ourselves? How would I feel when it is 10°C in London with a little breeze? How about a humid 25°C day in Hong Kong? No clue.
Many weather apps just put all those numbers on a single page. It is a <b>mess</b>.

## 2. Numbers are confusing

We usually rely on temperature or ‘<i>feels-like temperature</i>’ predicted in existing weather apps along with our past experiences to process how it would feel like after stepping outdoors. How reliable is that? How to interpret this indicator anyway? How do they know how I ‘feel like’? Do I need to wear a jacket when it feels like 10°C?

>> We are often overconfident in interpreting continuous variables.

## 3. They are inaccurate

Weather stations, using tools like thermometers that monitor vital weather signs, are far from accurate. There are not enough weather balloons (radiosondes) to constantly record conditions in the upper atmosphere, home to the real action. Pinning down the precise location of the event is notoriously difficult too. The distance between areas that are swamped with snow and ones with only a drizzle can be as short as 48 km (30 miles).

How badly can this weather uncertainty impact us? In economic terms, a 2011 study by the economist Jeffrey Lazo found that the US GDP alone could vary by as much as $485bn (£366bn), depending on the weather [1].

# Revolutionizing weather forecasting

We present <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/taro-weather/id1451553639?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>TARO Weather</b></a>, a revolutionized (free!) mobile app that presents the direct impact of upcoming weather conditions on <b>your health</b> and <b>well-being</b>.

## 1. Environmental Perception Engine

We are developing an AI-based personalized <b><i>Environmental Perception Engine (EPE)</b></i> that does all the number crunching for us based on our own <b><i>thermal comfort</b></i>. What we get is a crystal clear indicator of our body’s comfort level after taking all the influencing weather attributes and your comfort preferences into account.

Life is too easy and dull now? You can still go number-ninja and scuba-dive into the highly user-interactive ocean of TARO Weather’s weather forecast results in the back-end of EPE. Just don’t let the EPE know while you sneak!

## 2. Clothing Suggestion

>> We have you covered there.

How often do you face a situation where you are late to start the day and find yourself under the hammer of a countdown to get to work, or a meeting, or any other outdoor event? Or let’s say, no time for that morning coffee, and the nimble mind can’t decide whether you can wear your favourite shirt to work?

TARO Weather’s highly diligent and smart EPE suggests you what kind of clothing you need to consider if you step outdoors for optimal comfort — whether it is immediately, or in a few hours from now. Or, if you are considering planning your wardrobe, and doing your laundry adequately, the clothing suggestions for the entire upcoming week will certainly make your life easy peasy.
