Blockchain is not just about Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. It is also used for databases such as health records.

Contrary to a somehow popular belief, blockchain is not about data encryption. In fact, all the data in a blockchain is transparent. What makes it special is that it (to some extent) prevents backdating and data tampering. Let’s implement a minimal blockchain using Python. Here is how I built a minimal blockchain, and codes are available on <a href="https://github.com/edenau/Minimal-Blockchain" target="_blank">Github</a>.

Since this is a minimal implementation of blockchains, there will be no algorithms on any distributed network or Proof of Work.

# Hashing

We want a ‘key’ that can represent a block of data. We want a key that is <b>hard to fake or brute force, but is easy to verify</b>. This is where hashing comes in. Hashing is a function H(x) that satisfies the following properties:

- The same input `x` always produce the same output `H(x)`.
- Different (or even similar) inputs `x` should produce <b><i>entirely</i></b> different outputs `H(x)`.
- Computationally easy to get `H(x)` from input `x`, but intractable to reverse the process, i.e. getting the input `x` from a known hash `H`.

This is how Google stores your ‘password’ without actually storing your password. They store the hash of your password `H(password)` such that they can verify your password by hashing your input and compare. Without going into too much details, we will use SHA-256 algorithm to hash our block.

# A Minimal Block

Let’s make an object class called `MinimalBlock()`. It is initialized by providing an `index`, a `timestamp`, some `data` you want to store, and something called `previous_hash`. The previous hash is the hash (key) of the previous block, and it acts as a pointer such that we know which block is the previous block, and hence how blocks are connected.
